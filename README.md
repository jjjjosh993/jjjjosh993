# 👋 Hey, I'm Josh Clarke  

I'm an aspiring **Cybersecurity Analyst** from London with a background in **e-commerce operations, Shopify management, and fraud prevention**.  
After several years managing online platforms, transactions, and risk systems, I developed a deep interest in how digital threats work — and how to stop them.  

Currently completing the **Google Cybersecurity Certificate**, where I’m building hands-on skills in:

- Security auditing & vulnerability assessment  
- Network analysis and incident response  
- Linux file management & access control  
- SQL for threat detection and data analysis  

🧠 I’m especially interested in the overlap between **cybersecurity and e-commerce**, and how businesses can strengthen security without slowing down growth or customer experience.

### 🌍 A bit more about me  
☕ I function best after coffee and late-night problem-solving  
🎧 Music is a huge part of my life — I love collecting vinyl records  
🏃‍♂️ I’ve been getting back into fitness, running early mornings and daily gym seshs  
⛩️ I’m big on gaming and Japanese culture — usually replaying classic Pokémon on DS, keeping up with anime, and mixing that Tokyo-inspired style into everyday life
